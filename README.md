After My Tweaking,
recovering from sleep seems to be function well.
Do remember enable S3, S4 and S5 power state in BIOS setup!



Attention!
If you want to use another wireless network card to enable bluetooth and WiFi,
do make sure if the orginal wireless network card has already been disabled,
or the bluetooth will not function at all!
